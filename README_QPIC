----------------------------------------------------
1) Make sure the current directory contains the 'qpic.e' executable
file as well as the 'rpinput' file that you want to use.


----------------------------------------------------
2) Run 'openmpi.q' to access the MPI job builder user interface. Type
'Build' to build your job.


----------------------------------------------------
3) Use the following answers to the MPI job builder...


Name of the MPI program: qpic.e

Memory request (MB): 4096

[NOTE: Less than 4096 MB can cause the job to fail; more than 4096 can cause the job to queue forever. 4096 MB is the sweet spot.]

Time limit (hours): 8

Limit to group's cores?: y

Name of data center: msa

Number of tasks for job: 8

Arguments for the program: [leave blank]

Submit now?: n


After going through the full questionaire, quit the MPI job builder
tool by typing 'Quit'.

----------------------------------------------------
4) Once you've finished making your mpi job, there should be a file in
the current directory called 'qpic.e.cmd' that you can use to submit
your job to the cluster. Do so by entering the following command:

qsub qpic.e.cmd


----------------------------------------------------
5) Check on the status of your job using the following command:

qstat -u litos

[NOTE: Use your own user name in place of 'litos'.]
